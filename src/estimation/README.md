# Estimation Module

## Overview
The estimation module is responsible for simulating intents and calculating associated fees.

## Module Structure

```
estimation/
├── mod.rs       # Module root and public API
├── simulator.rs # Intent simulation logic
├── fees.rs      # Fee calculation engine
├── types.rs     # Shared types and structures
└── builder.rs   # Quote and response builders
```

## Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each submodule has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Extensibility**: New fee strategies or simulation methods can be added easily
4. **Type Safety**: Strong typing throughout to prevent errors

## Future Development

This module structure supports planned enhancements:
- Multiple fee calculation strategies (fixed, dynamic, auction-based)
- Simulation result caching
- Historical gas price analysis
- MEV protection mechanisms

## Dependencies

Currently, this module will depend on:
- `alloy`: For Ethereum types and RPC
- `crate::types`: For domain types
- `crate::error`: For error handling
- `crate::provider`: For blockchain interaction
